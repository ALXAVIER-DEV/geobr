# Step-by-step guide to become a contributior of **geobr**

If you would like to contribute to **geobr**, please open a [Github issue](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/issues) with your suggestion of ***function*** or ***dataset*** you would like to see in th package. 


As a rule, the package only includes geospatial data sets with national spatial coverage that are created/managed by govermental institutions and which are publicly available. 


Three Steps:
1. The contributor writes an `R` script that will prepare the raw original data set. Examples [here](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr/blob/master/prep_data)

2. The geobr team will validate the `prep_script` and save the data set in our server
3. The contributor writes the package function that will be used to download the proposed data
